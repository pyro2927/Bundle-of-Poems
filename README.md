# Bundle-of-Poems

The 'Bundle of Poems' found when cleaning my basement.  Retyped here exactly as they were found.

## Alfred

```
Alfred ate an apple,
Each and every Easter
'Til illness stuck him.
After pasta in the afternoon,
His mom said to go to bed.
He sat by his fat cat,
Who purred and stirred.
He fell asleep under his sheets.
```
## Godzilla
```
Once I bought a lizard.
He was so big I named his Godzilla.
Godzilla was so big he ate twelve of my sister's dolls.
He was so big he could wrap his whole body around my house.
He was so big he used our van as a heat rock.
Godzilla was so strong that he broke our jungle gym set with one claw.
I bought a saddle so I could ride Godzilla to school.
He was so smart he stopped ten robbers in their get-away cars.
```
## Hippos
```
Hippos happily hop about.
They roll around and around in mud.
Their ears wiggle like wet waffles.
They try to walk, but can only wiggle and waddle.
Baby hippos are chubby and cute creatures.
```
## Frogs
```
Frogs like to hop, hop, hop.
They hop and never stop.
As the day goes by,
They might eat a fly.
Once oculd hop across the road,
And meet a little toad.
If by any chance they were sad,
They could float on a lily pad.
```
## A Flame's Life Story
```
A man created me,
With the help of logs and matches.
It was a funny sight to see,
For his pants were full of patches.
He started to burn the wood,
And out of it I sprung.
He later put me out like he should,
But the water he threw on me really stung.
```
## Hero
```
Once I had a dream,
Where I was the hero.
POW! That alien's gone.
BANG! I knocked them over the head.
SQUISH! He needs a new toe.
BOOM! The enemy's plane is shot down.
SQUEEK! I try to sneak out without being caught.
I wake up and remember my heroic dream.
```
## Winter
```
The snow falls like bunches of leaves.
Bears settle down in their warm dens.
Little children put on their white ice skates,
And skate around in circles and figure eights.
Fires with oranges and reds are burned.
Babies sit silently watched the snow gently fall to the ground.
Squirrels try to find their hidden acorns.
Carolers go street to street to sing songs.
```
## Run, Run Away!
```
I visited the house on the hill.
They always said it was haunted.
When I entered, I heard a voice say,
"Run, Run Away!"
I thought it was my imagination,
But then again the voice said,
"Run, Run Away!"
I was scared so much I decided to,
"Run, Run Away!"
```
## Friend
```
Friend, you have always been there,
If I needed it or not.
You have always cared about me.
We would hang out at my house,
And tell jokes and annoy my sisters.
I remember when we would run around,
And ride on the mini-bike around the house.
I will always remember you, Friend.
```
## Snowboarding
```
I like to snowbaord.
It is so much fun.
You can do it off jumps and spin around.
If you fall it doesn't hurt because you would fall in snow.
```
